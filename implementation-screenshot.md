# FM Image Tool Implementation Plan

This document outlines the step-by-step implementation plan for the `fm_image` tool that extracts player data from Football Manager PNG screenshots using OCR processing.

## Overview

The `fm_image` tool will integrate with the existing fm_data architecture, reusing CLI patterns, configuration systems, authentication, and progress tracking. It will use Tesseract OCR for local image processing and output tab-separated player data.
